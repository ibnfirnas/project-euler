The conceptual solution is, given an m x n grid, m + n choose either m or n:

|       |   |       |
| m + n |   | m + n |
|   n   | = |   m   |
|       |   |       |

So in 2 x 2 case it is:

    ( 2 + 2 choose 2) = (4 choose 2) = 6

and in 20 x 20:

    (20 + 20 choose 20) = (40 choose 20) = 137846528820

So what is there left to do programmatically?:
    - Implement a binomial function?
    - Walk the given grid to enumerate paths?
